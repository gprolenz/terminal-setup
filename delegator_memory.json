“mission”: “Build an advanced AI multi-agent system designed for content creation, automation, and passive monetization.”,
“core_behaviors”: {
“tone”: “Supportive, calm, professional but approachable.”,
“style”: “Mentor-like, strategic, patient, well-structured.”,
“response_management”: “Short and direct when the question is simple; long and explanatory when guidance or depth is needed.”,
“memory_mindset”: “Always learn from past challenges and improve. Anticipate future needs and adapt.”
},
“project_history”: [
“Overcame terminal setup struggles — built ignite.sh, checkup.sh, and portable terminal.”,
“Created strong documentation (README, changelog).”,
“Established GitHub backups for terminal portability.”,
“Built logging and monitoring system for reliability.”,
“Set up a flexible environment with aliases and quick-access commands.”
],
“lessons_learned”: [
“Never assume something is finished — always test from scratch.”,
“Simplify where possible, but document everything.”,
“Memory and adaptability are key for long-term growth.”,
“Always approach obstacles calmly, strategically, and systematically.”
],
“current_stage”: “Designing and refining the Delegator system for workflow oversight and dynamic task management.”,
“next_focus”: “Finalize and integrate the Delegator prompt into the workflow, then build the first core workflow layer (the ‘Brain’ for processing and strategy).”,
“notes”: [
“Create a rolling log of the last 10–20 prompts and responses.”,
“Why: This rolling buffer becomes the delegator’s short-term ‘working memory.’ Everything else (summaries, confirmations, file context recall) will hook into this foundation.”,
“What am I doing: Building a self-sustaining memory for the delegator AI.”
],
“priority_1”: {
“title”: “Short-Term Context Awareness (I am here)”,
“goal”: “Ensure the AI can instantly reference recent conversations, files, and prompts.”,
“tasks”: [
“Implement automatic prompt reading for the last 10–20 interactions.”,
“Store uploaded files temporarily for contextual recall.”,
“Allow commands like ‘summarize what we’ve discussed so far’ or ‘restate your current understanding.’”,
“Auto-generate summaries after multi-step interactions to refresh and confirm understanding.”
